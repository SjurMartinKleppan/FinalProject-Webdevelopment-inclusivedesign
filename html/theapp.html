		      <p tabindex="0">Climate change, which often refers to global warming is the change in the global temperatures and weather on earth. Since the pre-industrial period,  
			meaning from year 1850 to today, the average temperature of our globe have risen by as much as 1°C. The 21st century have also seen a majority ofthe warmest
			years that have ever been recorded.The constant rising temperatures are greatly influenced by humans because of deforestation, fossil fuels and livestock farming making it a global problem that has to be dealt with.

    		  <p tabindex="0">The changes in temperature cause a number of problems, such as droughts, extreme weather and ice melting. You can see an example of the latter
		  in the picture below showing the drastic changes between the year 1883 and 2015 in Yosemite national park, USA.

		     </div>

      	 <p tabindex="0">Climate change and the consumption by humans is closely linked. A significant part of emission comes from factories creating consumer products
	  or powerplants producing water and electricity.This means that a large part of the worlds emission gets produced based what the consumers wants and needs.
	  Unfortunately the world consumption is skewed with the population of wealthy countries consuming much more than what is necessary to maintain a good standard of living.
      	  </p>

      	  <p tabindex="0">Norway is a good example of a wealthy country consuming way more than necessary. Looking at the graph from EnergiOgKlima we cna see that Norway 
		  had an CO2 emission per capita of 8.4 tons in 2016. This is way above the world average of 4.8 tons per capita. This makes it clear that the climate problem is not 
		  solely the responsibility of the countries creating the pollution, but also the nations that import and consume what is made.
