	  <p tabindex="0">As you can imagine from reading our Problem page, climate change is an enormous challenge with severe consequences. Unless we make changes to the way we 
						live and our consumption, millions of lives could be lost, species will go extinct and our world could at worst collapse.</p>
		 
      <p tabindex="0">Even though climate change is an enormous challenge, we have yet to reach the worst of its stages and its most definetely a solvable challenge. However
						its both a social and technological problem. We need to invest in technology to reduce existing emissions and use clean energy instead of fossil fuels.
						In addition we have to fight the spread of misinformation about climate change from those profiting from it, and help influence other to make change.</p>
		
		<p tabindex="0">We in Attero want to be able to help both from a technological and informative aspect. We want to inform our users about climate change through our
						site in an easy and simple way. In addition to help them make changes, stick to them and see their progress with our app!  </p>

      <h1 tabindex="0"> Adapt And Reuse</h1>
      <p tabindex="0">Stopping the development of climate change demands a change in our wasteful consumption culture, 
	  especially in wealthy countries. You as an individual can be a more climate friendly consumer by buying less and 
	  reusing more. Use your devices until they break, reduce the amount of meat you eat and buy the car that will last the longest. 
	  Make an effort to buy products that will last and think about how they could be affecting the climate.   </p>
	  
	  <p tabindex="0">In addition to think about your purchases, you can be more efficient with your resources. 
	  Unplug your devices to avoid them using electricity while not in use and replace inefficient gadgets such as 
	  old lightbulbs with new more efficient ones. Cut down on transportation where you can and prioritize walking, 
	  cycling and public transportation to your destinations when possible. </p>

      <h1 tabindex="0">Reduce Emission</h1>
      <p tabindex="0">Changing our consumption habits is not alone enough to stop climate change.  
	  We also need to reach a balance where there is less emission going out into the atmosphere than is taken out. 
	  To obtain this we need to move away from fossil fuels and change the way electricity gets produced. As well creating 
	  climate friendly transporting and agricultural systems.. </p>
	  
	  <p tabindex="0">To remove existing emission in the atmosphere we need to plant more forests and stop cutting down already existing forests.
	  As well as investing in the development of technology to remove emission from the atmosphere.  </p>
	  
	  <p tabindex="0">The implementation of these points will need large investments and cooperation across nation borders all over the globe.
	  What you can do is actively support politicians and leaders who take the climate crisis seriously and want to create the policies making 
	  the points above a possibility. </p>

      <h1 tabindex="0">Spread Information</h1>
      <p tabindex="0">Our solution is an app that logs the user and households emission. It measures electricity and water consumption,
         which means of transport you use when traveling, measure how much garbage the user throws away.
         It can also compare the user's consumption with the national average and at what times the consumption is the greatest.
         This way, you as a consumer can know if you have an unnecessarily high consumption of reasources and eventually get tips on how to lower this. </p>

            <h3>One day without meat</h3>
         	<p tabindex="0">
			<p>Have one meatfree day a week. An average Norwegian eats 18kg redmeat each year. That is on average 50 grams a day.
              After one year with one meatfree day a week, you can save 2.6 kg redmeat this is equlant to 52kg CO2 each year.</p>

			<h3>Fly less</h3>
            <p tabindex="0">
            <p>By cutting a leisuretrip with domestic and international flights every year, you can cut upto 268kg of CO2 per travler.
             1.55 milion Norwegians traveled abroad two or more times in 2014, so there is great potential here!</p>

             <p tabindex="0">
             <p>The heat exchanger is a vacuumpipe that is on the roof, the water in the pipe is heated by sunlight.
                This is water-borne heat, which can either be used to produce heat via a heatpump/heatconvector or to produce hot water.</p>
