		   <h1 tabindex="0">Problem: Klimaet er i endring.</h1>

		      <p tabindex="0">Klima endringer, som ofte refereres til global oppvarming er endringen av vær og temperatur over hele jorda. Since the pre-industrial period, 
			meaning from year 1850 to today, the average temperature of our globe have risen by as much as 1°C. The 21st century have also seen a majority ofthe warmest
			years that have ever been recorded.The constant rising temperatures are greatly influenced by humans because of deforestation, fossil fuels and livestock farming making it a global problem that has to be dealt with.

    		  <p tabindex="0">The changes in temperature cause a number of problems, such as droughts, extreme weather and ice melting. You can see an example of the latter
		  in the picture below showing the drastic changes between the year 1883 and 2015 in Yosemite national park, USA.

		         <h1 tabindex="0">Climate Change And Consumption</h1>
		     </div>

      	 <p tabindex="0">Climate change and the consumption by humans is closely linked. A significant part of emission comes from factories creating consumer products
		or powerplants producing water and electricity.This means that a large part of the worlds emission gets produced based what the consumers wants and needs.
	  Unfortunately the world consumption is skewed with the population of wealthy countries consuming much more than what is necessary to maintain a good standard of living.
      	  </p>

      	  <p tabindex="0">Norway is a good example of a wealthy country consuming way more than necessary. Looking at the graph from EnergiOgKlima we cna see that Norway
		  had an CO2 emission per capita of 8.4 tons in 2016. This is way above the world average of 4.8 tons per capita. This makes it clear that the climate problem is not
		  solely the responsibility of the countries creating the pollution, but also the nations that import and consume what is made.

	     <h1 tabindex="0">Potential Consequences From Climate Change</h1>

    	 <p tabindex="0">Climate change will and is already having large consequences on our earth. The problems is not limited to some parts of the world but will
		 rather impact the whole globe. Some of the main challenges climate change is causing can be read about below:
    	  </p>

	  <div class ="tipsboks">
  		    <div class = "kort">
				<h1>Water Increase</h1>
        		<p tabindex="0"> The increasing temperatures are causing ice and glaciers to melt, producing water and making the sea levels rise.
				Rising sea levels will cause damage to coastal areas and make entire islands go below sea level.
				Climate change is also causing an increase in rainfall, which in turn can lead to flooding in areas that is not coastal.
        	  </p>
  		    </div>

        	<div class = "kort">
			<h1>Heat and Drought</h1>
            <p tabindex="0">The CO2 that gets released into the atmosphere is making it harder for the heat to regulate around the world, and in turn leads to
			the world becoming warmer.
			<br>
			The higher temperatures will and is causing frequent heat waves, droughts and crop failures around the world.  </p>
          </div>

        	 <div class = "kort">
			 <h1>Extreme Weather</h1>
            <p tabindex="0"> Climate Change is also causing extreme weather to be even worse and more frequent. The increase in ocean and air temperatures
				are making the hurricanes and big storms more severe, Big storms like Hurricane Harvey have gone from occuring every 100 years to every 16 years.
				there have also been an increase in extreme droughts and forest fires.</p>
          </div>

        	<div class = "kort">
			<h1>Wildlife Extincion</h1>
               <p tabindex="0">The increasing temperatures will have severe consequenses for the animal and plant species on earth.
			   Multiple freshwater and marine species have had to relocate to new areas. In addition will some species, both plant and animal, be at a bigger risk 
			   of going extinct unless we do something about the increasing temperatures.</p>
          </div>

		<div class="innhold2">
		     <div id="bot">
		         <h1 tabindex="0">Climate Change and existing inequality</h1>
		     </div>
			 
		<p tabindex="0">Climate change will not only affect the world directly through droughts, extreme weater and water increase, but also in multiple indirect ways. 
						Which will hit the ones living in poverty stricken regions the most of all.
			
      	  </p>
		  
		  <h4> Price Spikes And Food Shortages</h4>

      	 <p tabindex="0"> An increased amount of droughts will make it harder to producce essential foods such as wheat and corn. Which in turn
		 will lead to food shortages and make food more expensive.This will make life much harder for those who already live in extreme poverty and struggle 
		 to obtain supplies.
      	  </p>
		  
		  <h4> Mass Migration</h4>
		  
      	  <p tabindex="0">
		  Increasing temperatures and risisng seal levels could potentially make large amounts of land and regions inhabitable. Forcing the people living 
		  there to relocate. This will lead to mass migrations of climate refugees. These mass migrations could turn into conflicts and wars over the resources 
		  and land least affected by climate change. It is estimated that there could be as many as one billion climate refugees by 20150.
